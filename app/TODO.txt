X	Create a pass-turn option if script potentially detects an infinite loop, do this by counting then number
    of complete iterations and then when reaching a certain point, insert a blocking node into the script
    which does nothing but ensures the turn ends for that robot, this will fix poorly made scripts
    and those that get stuck, causing them to do nothing instead of crashing the game

X 	Edit the script class to keep track of whether or not a function was called during the entire runthrough,
    and a number to see how many times in a row that happened. Related to above issue.
